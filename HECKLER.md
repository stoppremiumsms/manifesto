Premium SMS is a system that allows small 3rd party content service providers to bill mobile service consumers of large and reputable end carriage service providers (like Telstra, Optus and Vodafone) for services that the _3rd party content provider claims_ the consumer has signed up for.

The flaw with the system as it is operated by Telstra, and perhaps others, is that Telstra makes
no attempt, prior to transferring its liability to the 3rd party provider from itself to its own customer, to verify that the claim of "signup" made by the 3rd party represents the actual informed consent of the consumer.

I know this, because I myself was a victim of a fradulent claim that I had provided actual informed consent to signup to a Premium SMS service. The first charge was posted to my account with the same timestamp as a message confirming my alleged subscription appeared on my phone.

When I probed Telstra for proof that I had provided actual informed consent for the signup, I was dismayed to discover that not only did Telstra not hold such records, neither too did the 3rd party service provider.

My dismay deepened when I realised that two calls to the 1300 services associated with the service (one recommended by the Telstra CSR, one dialied by the keys in my pocket) resulted in an additional $38.42 charge appearing on my bill. 

After many, many hours engaged in a complaints process with Telstra, Telstra refunded my direct financial losses ($46.16) however they have refused to acknowledge that they should not have even applied the charges to my bill unless they had in their possession incontrovertible proof that the charge had been authorised.

This system as it currently operates is fundamentally rigged against the mobile phone consumer in favour of both the end carriage service providers
and the shady 3rd party service providers who nestle under their mothering wings. It needs root and branch reform. It should be dismantled and, if deemed necessary at all, rebuilt on foundations that put consumer protection at its very core.
