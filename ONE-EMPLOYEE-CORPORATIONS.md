#One Employee Corporations

This idea has a certain simple elegance, I think you may all agree.

Labour relations:
* No employees - everyone is an owner
* No employees - no unions
* No unions - no union corruption

Power:
* small co-operative entities, no aggregate power

Patents:
* no aggregate power, no patents

Ideas:
* no patents, ideas can be free

Meritocracy:
* if your ideas are good, you do very well in life
* if your ideas are so-so, you do just as well as everyone else
* bye, bye CEO pay excesses
* I predict Joanne at Surf Dive and Ski is going to do very well. Love you, Joanne!

Humanity:
* if ideas are free, humanity wins.

Government:
* has one business - ensuring everyone has their very own corporation

All secured by blockchain for an open and transparent society.

All because @Telstra is so useless. Well done. @Telstra.

Goodbyte corporatism.

Any chance you can pick me up the airport. I'll be drinking coffee in the cafe.

Did anyone mention I had stumbled over a simple solution to a broken system
that had been staring every one in the face for a very long time.

Hey Americans, are you still squabbling over Citizens United after all time? Wake sheeple, wake up!
