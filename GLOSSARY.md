#GLOSSARY

_This is a set of terms that might help people who don't understand the Australian Premium SMS system and its deeply important function in Australian society. Some parts of the terms in this document may be similar to terms found in the [industry website](19sms.com.au), but really, that site doesn't do justice to the system it serves so take their words with a grain of salt_

##Non-Repudiation

The act of making a mark on a legal contract that prevents the marking party from later denying to the other party that they ever agreed with, informed consent, to the said contract.

Used extensively by Telstra to market and sell its own services, but used rarely with Premium SMS Australian Edition (TM) services installed by default on every new mobile handset as made [abundantly clear](https://www.telstra.com.au/help/download/document/things-you-need-to-know-about-telstra-services-c048.pdf) by the terms and conditions of the standard Telstra Mobile Service contract.

Support for 3rd party Premium SMS services is scheduled for a future release (or perhaps a patch release) of Premium SMS Australian Edition (TM).

##Premium SMS Australian Edition (TM)
A peculiarly Australian strain of a previously wide-spread global scourge that is locally referred to by
the more conveniently used brand name - Premium SMS - which has the advantage of conveying a sense of quality rather than the kind of stagnated technical backwardness implied by the full term. Mobile Service providers tend to use only the abbreviated phrase in all marketing materials used to promote the infectious agent.

This strain of the infection has proved particularly problematic to eraditcate because it induces sleeping sickness in the population of Federal Parliamentarians and apathy in the remainder of the population.

Readily cured by appropriate doses of Awareness which, unfortunately, are no longer available under the PBS because of recent cutbacks in such schemes under the rubrik of "efficiency".

Hopes remain high that it will be eliminated following a forth-coming Emergency Act Of Parliament once the population receives its Awareness booster shots courtesy of a generously UN relief program funded primarily by Bosnia.

##Mandatory Opt-Out, Optional Opt-In

A controversial change expected to pass through Australian Parliament in its next seating.

This change would remove Premium SMS Australian Edition (TM) from all mobile handsets only to be restored if the customer provides company R with a proof of informed consent that the customer would like to
Opt-In to this option

Fortunately, the informed consent parts of this functionality can be quickly implemented since these features are already used on other parts of company R's website.

Consumer Protection advocates are absolutely livid about this change because it is going to make voting on MKR so frick'n tedious for the average mum and dad - and their inquisitive 2 year old kid who really likes
playing with daddy's mobile phone - who already have enough to do in this busy world with out having to visit a frick'n website every time they switch on the TV for godsakes. Policians? Who needs them.

##Burden Of Proof

A quaint technical term, sometimes used in legal circles, about some obscure and arcane principle of common law. Often reversed or ignored if inconvenient or expensive to obtain.

##3rd party billing contract

An extremely confidential commercial contract, between company F and company R which allows company F to trade on company R's superb corporate reputation, and market reach, in order to submit charges for imaginary services I to company R for payment by customer S.

Such contracts are never - I repeat never - disclosed to the full glare of public interest. That would be costly. Very costly.

S stands for sucker. Sometimes also known as a Company R Mobile Services consumer.

##Actual Informed Consent

It would be nice wouldn't, it? So nice. And fair. But really a whole lot of trouble for not really a whole lot of benefit.

Used extensively by company R to market and sell its own services, but currently used rarely in relation to 3rd party Premium SMS Australian Edition (TM) services conveniently available for all to use on company R's network.

More extensive support is expected to be available in a forthcoming patch release of Premium SMS Australian Edition (TM).

##Deemed Informed Consent

The form of Informed Consent used by Company R when making decisions to transfer a charge C, received on its own account from company F, to customer S.

Chief advantages are: reduction in code complexity, record keep requirements, obligations to the customer.

Possibly outlawed explicitly in a future release of Premium SMS Australian Edition (TM) because Section 51 of the 'Trade Practice Act' is a little bit long winded and is rarely applicable to fraud cases involving less than $7.

##Double Opt-In

A crutch rapidly installed by the Preimium SMS industry (and implicitly supported by the Australian Parliament) the last time the industry was almost crushed by consumer outrage.

Not currently implemented uniformly across all Content Service Providers and End Carriage Services.

Wouldn't actually be necessary if any kind of Opt-In actually worked.

##Online Opt-In

A form of opt-in used by 3rd party Premium SMS provides because it is super convenient, has very little transparency and is great for capturing deemed informed consent from customers of company R who are immoral enough to sometimes hit the wrong picture of breasts on an adult services (nudge, nudge, wink, wink) website.

Useless. Absolutely fucking useless for customer C in particular and principles of consumer protection in general, but fantastic for company F and not too shabby, also, for company R.

Online Opt-In - so new tech. It's a must have feature!

Shortly to be legislated out of existence by a snoring Australian Parliament when it eventually wakes up.

##Rolls of Toilet Paper

A measure of corporate fear about mistakes, past-made, in terms of an approximate estimate of the number of extra rolls of toilet paper that the Company R Legal department feels it needs in addition to normal requirements to properly balance the needs of customers (under Section 51 of the 'Trade Practices Act') and the needs of share holders under the ASIC rules regarding disclosures of 'material impact' and the more fundamental need for a good dividend unimpeded by the impact of an unexpected, but entirely predictable, class action law suit.

##The Real 'Scam'

(Lawyers have asked me to put 'Scam' in scare-quotes because it isn't a real scam committed with the malicious intent of company R. It looks like scam, but really - it isn't. It's just good old corporate incompetence which just happens to have remarkably health effect on company R's bottom line. How extraordinarily convenient)

The $1/m mobile phone charge that customer S spends waiting in the eternally busy "help" lines of company F after being referred there (following Section 6.1.9 of "Industry Code - Mobile Premium Services" - C637:2011) by company R who would couldn't really be bothered investigating customer S's dispute with company R that resulted from company R making use of "Deemed Informed Consent" to transfer a charge C received from company F on its own account to that of customer S.

If company R is really lucky customer S will be pretty proud with himself for getting back his $7 and won't notice that $20 he just spent on that phone call.

#Reality Distortion Field
A hitherto unanticipated extension theory of Einstein's theory of General Relativity that explains phenomena such as the unexpected reversals the Burden Of Proof (see above) that occur when reality passes in close vicinity of "Premium SMS - Australian Edition (TM)"

##Premium SMS Barring

The very first thing you should request when you ring the customer service department of your End Carriage Supplier (e.g. your telco) after finishing the reading and [retweeting](https://twitter.com/stoppremiumsms/status/720713050790072320) this document.

While you are there you might to ask for a refund for all those $20 calls you made to Premium SMS Australian Edition (TM) "help" lines in respect of disputed "sign up" with informed consent claims made by Australian telcos in the form of unexpected charges for Premium SMS Australian Edition (TM) services that appeared on your bill.

##Call To Action

Please make a fuss people.

On Twitter, on FaceBook, with your friends at the pub, with news paper letter columns, with blogs, in Whirlpool, on Slashdot and Boing Boing - you know everywhere.

But most importantly with your local members of the Federal Parliament.

We need this system to be dismantled. If there are people out there who think we need it rebuilt, then fine, rebuild.

But please use new timber and, this time, a bit of common sense.
