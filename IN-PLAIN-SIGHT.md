#A Lyrical Response To United Disbelief.

To all those who thought I was mad, here is a story of Dystopian vision, rendered so bad.

Look me straight up, if feel you so must.

This is a story, of ultimate glory.<br/>
Revealed line by line, an idea at a time.<br/>
Until hold it no more, you can not restore.<br/>
The view of time that did hold before.

Imagine a vision, a vision so clear<br>
Of a society so great, you could not overrate

A society of fairness and good,<br>
where no one thing, not one thing was kept under hood.

To Telstra my dear, I hear your fear

Unleash the forces, such as they may<br>
Which envision a future, where the people do not pay.

This is all that I say, as I make my good way,<br>
See you in Rio, or TIO,<br>
A happy coincidence one might say.

There is a certain logic that remain true,
as it does run right through.

The ability to rhyme,
is surely no crime.

If you really think, this is all wrong,
then delusion I do fear,
still remains strong.

##straight talk
If after, an open review of Telstra records in relation to Premium SMS lines shows this system is pure. If you can do this in a full public forum and you only get a handful of complainants, then
the clearly I was wrong.

Lock me up.  But let me go to Rio first. I am weird, but I am not dangerous as Surf Dive and Ski employee Joanne, 52 will readily attest.

If you only ask her. Once.

And please tell Glenn Greenwald I am on my way, after visiting George Monbiot the author of, oh the irony, The Age Of Consent and Bernie Sanders the Next President Of The USA.

Go for it man, you truly represent out interests, as do I.

A bit shout out also to Nicholas Nassim Taleb - love your work; Richard Dawkins - the selfish gene 	was wonderful; Terry Gilliam - Director of Brazil - also tale of dystopian horror but most of all to
Fabián Bielinsky  director of, as of this day, my favourite film of all time.

Nueva Reinas (2000)

Watch that film. Enjoy it. It is wonderful.

Now read read my arguments.

This is all manic. This who I am. I am:

Jon Seymour
Director, Wild Duck Theoies Australia Pty Limited
Pro-Bono Ethics Consultant To The Telecommunications Industry
Believer in a better world and the tech ideas to achieve it.

Take it or leave it.

And finally this, consider please, this:

Subject a just man to the crucible of unjust system and don’t be surprised if liquid metal results — Australian Proverb, 11 April 2016.

See you in Hobart - I am on my way to drop my phone off the bridge - subversive I know.


#My plans

- Hobart (MONA, I look forward to assessing your glory, at the end of this story)<br>
- Melbourne (To visit my friends who will make amends)<br>
- Brisbane (To visit Nic Suzor, the friend of the User)<br>
- Perth (To visit Nick Rimmer)
- Barcelona (To visit Club Baha, for a laugh of haha)

...

Anyway you get the drift. My thanks are to Telstra, for such a grand gift.

A life of Riley, complete with a smiley.

With this last poke, an attempt at a joke<br>
I will bid you farewell, and ask you to smell

A new dawn so fine, I claim it as mine<br>
Bernie do you have time, the coffee is mine?

If you ask where I am, I am right here in bed<br>
A promise once given, cannot be undriven.

Stay atune to the push, one tweet at a time<br>
Of a vision so sublime, you know it is time.

Of this I will say, a not a word any more.<br>
But ask you to think, again once more.

Of my phone you might reasonably ask,
Where does it now bask.

The answer is sweet, so please to do retweet.

In the bottomless harbour, a harbour so deep.
It confidences revealed it did never peep.

If you do have in mind, a query at hand.<br/>
Please reachout if you must, to a person of trust.</br>
That man is John Hadfield. Go do it, you must.</br>

To Thomas Hedley, do thee implore.
Please do research this story once more.

#Hard reality.

I sincerely believe there is a case to answer.

Ask my friends Adrian Jon Brown and Greg Mantzaris
who saw the final vision but because they do not
have Facebook profiles avoided the build Torrent.
Their reactions were very positive, which leads
me to think that the issue was not the ideas but
the manic desire to express them and the
resulting torrent of output in social media.

Ask Jasmine, the delightful - and I as learnt from the dudes at the Manly married Vodafone sales rep
when I visited.

Ask the woman who took one of the photos (the Vodafone one)

On my path in a loop which as passed Sydney Opera house, a seagull did poop [ yes, that rhymed - funny that ].

But go ask the Vodafone Sales rep in Pitt Street the story about what she said of the story of the poop on my head [ yes, I know - it rhymned again - I am very self ware about this]. She did actually say this.
It is a story which is true I am literally not making this up.

When I told her this story she said just this:

They say is good luck if a bird poops on your head.

But most of all speak to Joanne the 52-year old sales rep from whom I bought lots of clothes. Speak to her
collegue who also knows. [yes, there I go again - an example of media writ large].

If I might say so myself these people thought I was charming, eccentric and odd. She heard my story
briefly.

[Fuck, the words flow too freely]

You can say this is madness, a retelling of truth. The tweets are all there, in stunning good proof.
Ask her I dare, and lay it all bare.
If Julian Morrow, should arrive there tomorrow.

Ask a board of technical architects how a customer like me can prove that they did not subscribe to a
service when the level of evidence kept is so low.

If a world of 6 billion thinks it is Jon not the system who is mad then you are all in very deep trouble.
