#A Lyrical Response To United Disbelief.

To all those who thought I was mad, here is a story of Dystopian vision, rendered so bad.

This is a story, of ultimate glory
Revealed line by line, an idea at a time
Until hold it no more, you can not restore
The view of time that did hold before.

Imagine a vision, a vision so clear
Of a society so great, you could not overrate

A society of fairness and good,
where no one thing, not one thing was kept under hood.

A vision so clear, the people did hear
The call to action so great, the vision so great.

To Telstra my dear, I hear your fear

Unleash the forces, such as they may
Which envision a future, where the people do not pay.

This is all that I say, as I make my good way,
See you in Rio, or TIO,
As you might conpletely a victory so great.

#My plans

- Hobart (MONA, I look forward to assessing your glory, at the end of this story)
- Melbourne (To visit my friends who will make amends)
- Brisbane (To visit Nic Suzor, the friend of the User)
- Perth (to visit Nick, if only very quick) # that was not so good, I admit
- Barcelona (To visit Club Baha, for a laugh of haha)

Anyway you get the drift. My thanks are to Telstra, for a gift so grand.

A life of Riley, complete with a smiley.

With this last poke, an attempt a joke
I will bid you farewell, and ask you to smell

A new dawn so fine, I claim it as mine
Bernie do you have time, the coffee is mine.
