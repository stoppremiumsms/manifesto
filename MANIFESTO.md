#MANIFESTO

This movement is less than 1 week old and at last count had 9 supporters, 2 of which are me.

Sorry about that, I really didn't mean to "sign up" twice, but I can't tell you exactly which event was the
one that was the result of "informed consent" and which event was the result of "accidentally, but deliberately", clicking the wrong button at the wrong time. The reason I can't tell you is that I failed to keep sufficient documentation or logs deemed "sign up" events either on my servers or those 3rd parties I am contracted with. As your CSRs have asked, I will try to be more careful next time. I promise. Really.

Anyway, suffice to say, we haven't yet had chance to fully articulate what actions we want taken.

However are some rough thoughts for your consideration:

 * JUST FIX THIS SHIT ALREADY. OK?

Of back to demands of more a refined nature:


* An immediate acknowledgement, in the form of a press release distributed in the normal way by the CEOs of Telstra, Optus and Vodafone that there may be some merit to at least some of my concerns that I have raised since 18:44 April 7, 2016.

 Use of gently self-deprecating humour in those releases would be greatly appreciated by the punters - it may help salve the wounds - but I am sure your legal departments might have different opinions on these matters.

 That said it possible they are probably pre-occupied in unanticipated "Oh, Shit!" meetings right now, so see if you can slip at least a _few_ jokes through without their authorisation, ok?

 Remember, most amusing CEO wins!

Ok enough of the humour for now. Some serious points:

* For Telstra to state that it will provide to the ACCC open and transparent access to all its contracts, documentation and IT systems as it works to investigates ACCC complaint 66958 that I raised,
and will not try to use claims of commercial privilege to prevent any discoveries requested by the ACCC.

* An agreement with the Telstra CEO to work co-operatively with the Optus and Vodafone CEOs together to improve the quality and integrity of the Australian Premium SMS system over the longer term, should the Australian Parliament decide, after a thorough review by Parliamentary inquiry, that it provides sufficient
benefits to Australian society to outweigh its risks.

* A promise, by the 3 CEOs, to refund any and all customers who is materially out of pocket as the result of mobile phone calls to "help" lines associated with Premium SMS services during the course of disputes with either the corporations, or the related Premium SMS services, in relation to questions about whether the customer had "signed up" to those services with fully informed consent since the inception of the Premium SMS system in Australia. If, for whatever reason, sufficient documentation cannot be provided for some reason about a particular claim of a "sign up" event made by the corporations, then the corporations must deem that the customer did not, in fact, grant such consent and agree to reimburse each customer with the full cost of the calls made to any phone number that was a direct or indirect result of the receipt of an unsolicited SMS from those services, for each such event that occurred, if that in fact, has not already been done. This actions should be taken irrespective for all customers, past or present, whether such customers have requested the action or not.

* An agreement from all CEOs that all calls to "help" lines of Premium SMS services will be free to the customer who makes the call, if established from the mobile handset that is associated with the service
that the corporation, from this day forth irrespective for whatever legitimate reason these calls are made. For these purposes, raising a complaint about previous treatment by the services is to be regarded as a legitimate complaint.

* To actively support the establishment of a Parliamentary Inquiry to conduct a through and wide reaching review into the operation of the Premium SMS system in Australia since its inception and to assess whether the Premium SMS system has outlived its usefulness in 2016 since mobile phone technologies, and particular mobile payment technologies, have changed substantially since the Premium SMS system was first introduced.

* The CEOs of these corporations to support a call for an emergency act of the Australian Parliament to switch off the Australian Premium SMS network, or otherwise place severe restrictions on its continued operation, until such time as the Parliamentary inquiry into these matters is complete

* Full Disclosure of any relevant technical reports the corporations hold about the prevalence of click-bait and other kinds of web scams that have contributed to revenue gained by either the corporations or the 3rd party billers they are contracted with in relation to the operation of Premium SMS services since their inception and a full an accurate estimate of that revenue sufficient for consumer protection advocates
to determine whether it would be worthwhile for class action law suits in relation to these matters.

* Full Disclosure of any legal impediments in their contracts with 3rd party billers that have prevented the corporations behaving more responsibily towards their own customers with respect to Premium SMS services since their inception.

* Full Disclosure of the mechanisms the corporations use to ensure that they have, in fact, obtained adequate proof of fully informed consent about a customer's decision to "sign up" to a Premium SMS service prior to a charge in relation to such a service appearing on a mobile service consumer's account.

* In my own interests, for the corporations to indemnify me, for all time, from any legal actions taken either by themselves or any entity they have held a contract at any time with since 18:44 on April 7, 2016, in relation all matters directly or indirectly relating to this issue.

* To fully protect from unauthorised disclosure, for all time, any private and personal data the corporations hold about me now, in the past or in the future irrespective of whether that information is any way related to this dispute or not and to otherwise not attempt to exercise corporate power of any kind to silence my dissent, or the dissent of others, about these matters.

* If the CEOs agree to these terms, issue a signed letter and press release to this effect, witnessed by the following people:

	* Julian Morrow (Lawyer/Journalist/Funny Guy)
	* Ezekial Ox (Singer/Social Activiist)

	* Phillip Adams (Broadcaster)
	* David Marr (Journalist)
	* Richard Ackland (Journalist)
	* Samantha Maiden (Journalist)

	* Tanya Plibersek (Federal Member for Sydney)
	* Scott Ludlam (Federal Senator for Western Australia)

If these conditions are met, as witnessed by those listed above, then I promise to tone down my ridicule and work constructively with the industry to help make it better.

Yours Sincerely

Jon Seymour

By The Harbour On A Sunny Friday Morning,
Sydney, Australia
15th April, 2016

Approximately 6.5 days since I first became aware I had been scammed by the Australian Premium SMS industry,  24 hours previously.

#Back to the humour because it has been a long 6.5 days and I need a break

* If the CEO any corporation has suffered material loss (as opposed to stomach contents) as the result of my "accidental, but deliberate" sign up event referred to above, then I promise to help sort you out. Well, I won't help you out personally, of course - that'd be too time consuming and isn't really my responsibility even if the principles of natural justice might mislead you into believe that it was - but I do promise the help line of the Premium SMS service that I have deemed that you have all signed up to as the result of reading this text, will. You can use the site 19sms.com.au to find the number of the help line - just type in the 19xxxxx of the unsolicited SMS message that I just sent to your phones. Remember to read the detailed terms and conditions before you sign up with full informed consent. Oops, too late. Better luck next time, I guess.

* May I suggest that as you sit in the evitable queue while waiting for service from the "help" line that you brush up on what the terms "duty of care" to customer mean, as defined by Section 51 of the 'Trade Practices Act'.

* Apologies if you don't like the hold music - it's Rage Against The Machine I particularly like the song "Fight The Powers That Be", so I tend to run it on a loop. Still 5 times isn't much, is it, for such a great song?

* Remember, don't use a landline because it is going to cost you a hefty $1/min - or an average of $20 to not get help, but receive fantastic "help" from those guys if you use your mobile phone to make the call. If only the Telstra CSR had warned me of that in the chat when I had my only problems last Friday - it would have saved you hassle of having refund me $38.42.

* By I was quite surprised how much that it was - over 5 times the cost of the original charge ($6.99) I was almost, but not quite, visibly upset about. I wasn't truly visibly (and audibly) upset happened, much to the distress of the my fellow patrons at the Dunkirk, a few days later during the wind up my complaint when I was screaming at your Complaints CSR and her supervisor when the notion finally dawned on me that the system is totally fucked and completely rigged against the little guy most of who really have no clue how to press such complaints.

* In fairness $38.42 was actually for 2 calls, not one - not even the little terrier that I am has the persistence to wait on a "help" line for a full 38 minutes. There was an earlier call at 18:49 on April 7 for $18.22 that occurred when the keys in my pocket accidentally dialled some bogus 1300 line in a link that appeared when an unsolicited SMS from 19900019 arrived on my phone 3 minutes earlier. Of course, I didn't even realise this had happened until 2 days later at 23:45 when I thought it might be wise to carefully check all the recent charges that had been applied to my bill just in case something else unexpected at happened. And, lo! - it had!

* $38.42 is a lot of money - must make quite a nice contribution your bottom line, eh? It would be a shame if a large number of other customers checked their own phone bills - for the months before they asked you to put a Premium SMS Bar on their mobile service - and started to call you back to seek similar refunds. Could expensive in employee time alone - let alone the cost of the refunds themselves.

* Mmm. Ugly. How's drafting of the press release going, BTW? I think you are going to need it sooner than you might have otherwise think. Those jokes better be rippers is the only advice I can give. Don't forget to tell the shareholders how this issue might affect their dividend this quarter. One of the A*** agencies (can't remember which one) as rules about that, you know, a shareholders are quite protective of their own
interests and get really pissed of if the directors fail to disclose an issue of matertial concern at the most appropriate moment. You thought customers were rude so and so's when they ring about all drunk and
angry. Wait until you hear from shareholders. They are awful, just awful.

* Sorry, that's not the correct term in this in this industry is it - a refund is what you give when you admit you have stuffed up. That never happens in this industry. No what was the term your CSR used? That's right - a credit. That's a much better term because that's the term you correctly use to describe an amount which you generously give to a customer when they have made a silly little istake and you want them to make them feel better again. Especially after you meaningless phrases like "accidentally, deliberate" and they start to seriously reconsider their own attachment to and grasp on reality.

* ps: any punters reading along. Don't worry your grasp on reality is just fine - it's just reality itself
is a little distorted because of the nearby presence of a reality distorion field otherwise known as the Premium SMS System - Australian Edition (TM). When that thing is nearby all sorts of weird things happen - like unexpected reversals of the burden of proof. It's Einstein missed something fundamental when he did all that good work so many years ago.

* Anyway, thanks for agreeing to pay me back when I contacted you again to complain after I later discovered these charges on my bill thinking I had already got my $6.99 credited + a nice little $3.01 bonus rounding
it to a cool an crisp $100. Am I a winner, or what?

* Back to the hold music, I would have put on my all time favourite band - Mammal - but Zeke and the boys broke up a few years back (so they couldn't appear live this morning). My mobile phone that does have a copy of their album on it, but it is otherwire indisposed at the moment.

 ps: Zeke get the band back together for at least one gig, ok. I'll even come to Melbourne for the gig since I have heard the nightlife down there is so much better than our own these days for a reason I haven't quite been able to put a finger on. Ah that's right, moralising policitians! If only they concerned themselves with more constructive pursits - such installing more phone lines at the NSW Department of Fair Trading. Must be nice to have socialist in power down there these days. Hopefully we will have one here again, one day soon.

* Anywhoo, CEOs, Good luck with the "help" line, and have a nice day.

* ps: what subclause of Section 51 of the 'Trade Practices Act' are you up to right now? Keep reading.

* I seem to be have trouble getting this campaign the media attention than I think it probably deserves. If anyone reading this knows anyone in the media, particularly the quality media like the Guardian, ABC or SBS or any those members of the media listed above, could I please ask that you send a link to this text to them, particularly if those journos have been victims of a trivial $7 Premium SMS scam themselves.

* I give you my guarantee that his page does not contain any click-bait but please don't hold me to that because my actions in respect of duty of care of your interests are impeded by the contracts I hold with my 3rd party service providers.

* If any journalist would like to contact me about this issue, in case my [blog](http://blog.stoppremiumsms.org) or associated [resources](github.com/stoppremiumsms/resources) and Telstra or ACCC complaints have not done that with sufficient thoroughness or clarity, then please get in touch with me at stop@stop.premiumsms.org.

* I would also appreciate to be contacted by publishers or authors would like to write a book about the
long sorry tale of systemic dysfunction. Having only stumbled across as recently as 18:44 April 8 last week, it has been something of an eye-opener for me, I can tell you. It should be ripper. I already have the title: "STOP! A breathtaking, many layered story of systemic dysfunction. Australian Edition (TM)"

* And Tanya, give me a call, I don't have my phone with my and I haven't quite worked out that Skype thingy yet. Perhaps next Monday after this furore has started to die down a bit. No, not next Monday that's the 18th. No I mean Monday the 25th. No that's no good - Anzac Day. How about April the 26th. Not my actual birthday, but pretty close. It would be real treat!

* The text of this page or any other page on this site may be altered at any time in the future without prior notification to, or consent from, readers being required. Such edits will usually be because of a typo, a spelling mistake, a grammar error but sometimes of the failure on my part to previously squeeze in another good line, idea or joke at the right time because I hadn't thought of that line, idea or joke yet.

* The Terms and Conditions associated with the use of this site are not disclosed anywhere on this site, because it is a real hassle to do so, just in case I change my mind about those Terms and Conditions are.

* A helpful [glossary](https://github.com/stoppremiumsms/resources/blob/master/GLOSSARY.md) of terms that will help interested citizens learn more about the sometimes mystifying operation of the Premium SMS System Australian Edition (TM). Note that the definitions provided in that document differ from those given on 19sms.com.au but have the advantage of being way funnier and a little bit closer to the truth.

* Apologies if I you haven't been able to contact me this morning - Manifesto writing in the public interest (but particularly the requisite jokes - virality is so hard to achieve these days with so much superior content out there - like 1900 click-bate) is hard (and sometimes thirsty) work, and needs the thought space that a view of the Opera House and Circular Quay affords. Fortunately I have one those right now, but I do not have Internet access or indeed my phone. Fewer distractions I guess.

* my mobile phone is locked at home in a metal safe with its SIM card removed because I am not 100% convinced that it will be safe from denial of service attacks from a bot army owned by the operators of Premium SMS services who are a little sad, right now, that their game is now up and their fig leave of cover  (otherwise affectionally referred elsewhere to as Industry Code - Mobile Premiums Services - C637:2011) has nibbled away by The Internet Rabbits Of Doom. Yeah, I know, you told me you have placed a Premium SMS Bar onto my service but trust, particularly trust in corporations who used to look after their customers interests, but nt longer appear to be so strongly compelled or incendeted to do so (because of legal impediments and obligations to other third parties), is rather thin on the ground these days.

* By the way, if any corporation would like to get ahead of themselves and their competitors and publish revised terms and conditions that are fully consistent and take account of the concerns expressed here and elsewhere then I am sure it will be very cathartic for you and rewarding for your shareholds and customers - if you still have any.
