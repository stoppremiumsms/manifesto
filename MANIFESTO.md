#Back Story
Andy is a little surprised by his new role as my press officer, primarily
because he had no idea that he'd signed up for it. But that's the thing -
the Internet is a dangerous place these days - scams everwhere, like you
wouldn't believe! I know you know that, but I didn't know that and so too, it seems,
neither does Andy.

But the most important thing is that neither do our customers -
we make more revenue if they are less informed about such things.
And we make absolutely heaps when they are completely clueless about the notion of
informed consent and how important it is do demand that your provider has some
actual proof, like records and shit, that it was actually given when you
enter into a dispute with your provider about such matters.

For example, I had no idea either until 18:44 on April 8 when
I realised I had been scammed by the entire Premium SMS - Australian
Edition (TM) service industry a full 24 hours previously when an unsolicted SMS
arrived on my phone at almost the exact same moment as $6.99 charge was
posted to my phone account. The Internet is so fast these days. Isn't it awesome?

So convenient too. Did you know you can sign up to a Premium SMS Service in a matter of
seconds without troublesome things like actual terms and conditions, double opt-in
authentication, authentication of any kind, actual informed consent, logs or business ethics.
It's amazing.

In fact, today Premium SMS - Australian Edition (TM) brings to Australian shores
features long banned elsewhere. Clueless consent. Or as the industry likes
to called "Deemed Informed Consent". Not quite as robust as "Actual Informed Constent"
but so much faster and so much less paper work and book keeping. Not to mention
the amount disk space for log files. Remember though that if you intend to deploy
Clueless Consent into your network your legal department is eventually going
to need extra supplies of toilet paper (by 16:30, if they haven't exhausted their supplies already),
so be prepared.

But seriously Andy is a busy man these days, what with network outages and the whole gay marriage thing, both at the same time. What a workload. Yeah, and CEO of Telstra. That must be a lot of work too - but at least job comes with all kinds of short cuts you take in order to get things done quickly.

Anyway back to a record of a conversation I had with Andy earlier in the day. To protect
Andy's privacy I won't leak the full audio, just provide you with a transcript. To set
some context and his complaint that he sincerely didn't provide any informed
consent to become my press office.

Andy, what do you mean you didn't read in the print in my Linked In profile? If you had been
paying attention you would have noted I'd carefully encoded these terms and condition
my Linked In profile which clearly stated in no less than 6pt font that any viewing of this profile would be deemed into mean that you had provided inform consent to become my press office. Yeah, right there,
under the convenient invisible button.

Andy, you really, should not have clicked on my LinkedIn profile if you didn't want to become
press officer in my service. I know you don't know me from Adam, Andy. (Adam is my offsider, by the way, brother of Eve) and you know even less about my organisation. That's ok Andy, I intend to teach you. You can find a primer in the complaint I sent through on Tuesday night a slight variant of which I also sent to the ACCC a day later. Its a over 5 pages long. I know a long read, but I had to get a lot off my chest.

Anyway, I'll forgive you this time, but next time be more careful. These mistakes can be expensive you
know and they can take minutes, even as long as 20 minutes, on the phone to the
"help" line of your Premium SMS Service provider to not sort these things out. I know, it takes longer
than 20 minutes once you take into account the number of times you have to call but if you were more
careful, these things wouldn't happen.

BTW: I'll let you in on a little industry secret - best not to use your mobile phone to call the
"help" line. Normal customers don't get this advice Andy, but you are specical guy. Use your
landline. It is cheaper.

Why? Did you know that your telco generates revenue at the standard rate for a call to a 1300 line of
around $1/min every time you call the Premium SMS Service "help" line at the recommendation
of your telco.

I know that when you were provided with a link to to the "help" line by that handy 19sms.com.au site,
your thought it was an actual help line and that the cost of calling it would be free. That's your mistake again, Andy. It wasn't a help line - it was a "help" line. There is a difference - check the terms and conditions of your contract with me. You know, that one that also obliged you to become
my press officer when you clicked on my Linked profile. You didn't read those terms? Silly you.

Yeah, I know you didn't realise that you could enter into contract with me
with an accidental action like clicking on a e-mail that one of your colleagues
in the legal department had flicked through.

I know. Look, I know that when you signed up for your Optus mobile service [yeah, I know, a little strange - I have two words for you: Network Outages] you were dealing with a reputable
corporate citizen who applies the same standards of integrity and fairness across
the entire product line - including across the range of Premium SMS services offered on
the Optus network.

But, again Andy, you didn't read the terms and conditions of the mobile
service contract clearly enough did you? Andy, don't angry. Let me explain,
in those terms and conditions you will find that we specifically highlight
that Premium SMS service providers - primarily being fast buck merchants who know a good opportunity when they see one - aren't required to operate with the same standards of corporate ethics as the mothership network that gives them access to the network's customers and those customer's billing accounts.

Just for billing purposes, you understand - nothing strange in that. It's not the 1980's any more people -
we now have sophsiticated and easy mobile payment methods like SMS. It's a great system - you can receive an unsolicited SMS on your phone and unsolicited charge on your phone bill and takes, what, only 1-2 hours
ok maybe 4 hours to sort it out. And you end in credit by $5. How good is that? Andy? Andy? Where have you
gone Andy?

Hey supe, I think I just lost a customer, no wait I think he just called back. Yep, it's him.

Andy! Your'e back. We are so pleased, thank you for calling back.
What do you mean there is no such term and condition in your contract? My, that was
an oversight wasn't it? Don't worry your pretty little head about it. I am sure someone will
fix it some day. Remember, though, that our hands are tied somewhat by our opaque contracts
with 3rd parties - we have to provide them with access to our networks for example.
Outrageous, I know. Our lawyers said there is nothing they can do. It would require a legislative change
and no-one in this industry is up for that. Too much work.

Look, I can't give you a refund - we don't do that in this industry. I can give you a
credit and look, since you are such a nice guy, I'll kick in extra $5. Your even. Actually, no you are ahead.
Ok, once you deduct the $20 charge you accrued while waiting on our "help" line
you are still $15 behind. It's enough to make you accept the loss and give up, right?

Don't worry, Andy, since you noticed this $20 charge on your bill and called
us back about it, we are willing to give you an additional credit for $20 in addition to
the $10 credit we have already credited your account with in respect of
that $5 so you are still ahead. Look a winner again, Andy. My you are getting pretty good at this
whole complaints thing now Andy, aren't you. No, we don't automatically offer such credits to all customers in this situation, only those like you who care enough to call back.

What about the system, you ask Andy? Don't worry about the system Andy, the system - it can look after itself.

It's not a bad business model, we lose on some those particularly quarrelsome customers, but we keep them happy. Most of the time anyway, although we are starting to have a few issues this week for some reason. And we make a motza on the others who can't be bothered to call back. The best thing about this system? Keeps the share holders happy. And if there is one thing you want to do in this industry, it is keeping shareholders busy because if you think customers are bad you have never seen how tenacious those share holders bastards can be when looking after their own interests.

Anyway, enough for now Andy. Just make sure that press release is ready for 16:30 sharp. And make it funny, really funny.
