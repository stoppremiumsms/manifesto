**Subject a just man to the crucible of unjust system and don’t be surprised if liquid metal results — Australian Proverb, 11 April 2016.**

The above inspired by the white hot anger I felt when I realised how fundamentally broken the Australian Premium SMS system in Australia is.

This campaign has been setup to help inspire similar anger in others to motivate change in the system. It isn’t about the $6.99 loss I suffered. It really isn’t. I have, with my own informed consent, incurred an additional finanical penalty to myself of over $3000 in the last week by taking 5 days off work to help kick this thing off.

It is about the same problems happening over, and over, again. First to this person, then to that person. Most people get over a $7 loss pretty quickly. It is 2 beers. Ok, Sydney prices, 1 beer. What really makes me angry is that the system can’t fix this problem by itself because the individual losses are so small, no one has the motivation to fix the thing that keeps causing them – the system itself.

So every day, new people get scammed, $7 at time. Or, it actually might be as much as $20 as the following argument will show.

Every time someone spends $20 of their own money waiting in the queue of a Premium SMS help line to recover a $7 loss, the system has won. The consumer thinks they have won – ‘Yay! I got my $7 back’ almost certainly not realising that to recover that $7 they had to spend $20. If they don’t realise they have done that, they have just lost $20 when they thought they were even. And who pockets that $20? Telstra. Telstra, who was directly responsible for referring them to the Content Services help line in the first place. And why did they need to be referred? They were referred to the help line by Telstra who currently does not have an effective way to verify that Premium SMS “sign up” claims presented to them by 3rd parties are the result of informed consent by the account holder.

This then is the thing that really makes my blood boil – that Telstra is profiting from its own incompetence – even if it isn’t doing it intentionally. 

(BTW: I am pretty sure it isn’t doing it intentionally, because I don’t think the aggregate corporate intelligence of Telstra is that smart and the conspiracy would have to be too vast. So the simpler explanation suffices – if you have a choice between malice and incompetence, chose incompetence every time). 

So Telstra no, you aren’t doing this with malice. But it still stinks just the same.

I was also quite irked by the Telstra complaints CSR who said something like this to me:

_But we have to bill you because the 3rd party billed us and we have to transfer the charge somewhere!_

Really, Telstra? Really? The reason I have to accept your incompetence is so that your bottom line doesn’t suffer. Well diddums to you, big guy!
